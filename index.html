              Hey there! thanks for stopping by at my humble domain. My name's Abby and I'm a software developer.
              I grew up the San Fernando Valley, went to school in Berkeley, and then moved to New York 4 months after I graduated for App Academy.
              I've been here in New York since November 2017, and I'm absolutely in love with this city. So if you're a New-York based company looking for a full-stack developer, I'm your girl üôãüèª
              <br>
              <br>
              Aside from coding, I really enjoy playing soccer and volleyball. I'm also into hanging out and getting some work done at cafes with great almond milk cappucinos. I'm easy to please so those
              aren't hard to find. After hours, catch me on the dance floor at any bar with good music and no cover charge üï∫üèº
            </p>

            <h2>Stuff I Know</h2>

            I'm currently a Senior Instructor at App Academy, where we teach Ruby, SQL, Rails, Javascript, React, and Redux. So I'm pretty good at those things.
            I also know a bit of Vue (which I learned and used to make this website!)
          </section>

          <section id="cares">
            <h2>Stuff I Care About</h2>
            I'm passionate about creating a comfortable environment in tech for people of all identities.
            I lead bi-weekly Diversity and Inclusion roundtable discussions at App Academy.
            These are optional lunch-time discussions where we talk about issues in tech such as diversity, bias, representation, and discrimination.
            I also organize the Women of App Academy group, where I host meetings for women going through the program with those who have graduated so that we can connect over our experiences -- and delicious snacks.

          <section id="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            Check out <a href="https://aa-slap.herokuapp.com/#/">this project</a> I made! It's called Slap, and it's a clone of the messaging app Slack. I made it from scratch, so I'm pretty proud of it.
            It's got a Rails backend and a React/Redux frontend. Building this project really showed me the power of Rails associations, Jbuilder, Redux, and building reusable React components.
            I'm really happy with how my DMs are implemented. When you 'remove' a DM, if you try to create one with the same people, rather than creating an entirely new DM, that existing
            DM and its messages will be fetched from the database (just like Slack :)) I also implemented debouncing, so that when searching for users or channels, the search query will fire off
            only once the user stops typing for .5 seconds.

            Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read all this! Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about code, my experiences at App Academy, issues regarding Diversity and Inclusion in tech,
            or anything at all really! I'm also happy to provide help and mentorship if you're looking for that. If you're interested in hiring me, that'd be really cool too. Just shoot me an email if you wanna talk!
